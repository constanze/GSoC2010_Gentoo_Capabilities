#
# this is a sample capability file (to be used in conjunction with
# the pam_cap.so module)
#
# In order to use this module, it must have been linked with libcap
# and thus you'll know about Linux's capability support.
# [If you don't know about libcap, the sources for it are here:
#
#   http://linux.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/
#
# .]
#
# Here are some sample lines (remove the preceding '#' if you want to
# use them

## user 'morgan' gets the CAP_SETFCAP inheritable capability
##cap_setfcap		morgan

## user 'luser' inherits the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability
#cap_dac_override	luser

cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw netadmin 

## 'everyone else' gets no inheritable capabilities
none  *

## if there is no '*' entry, all users not explicitly mentioned will
## get all available capabilities. This is a permissive default, and
## probably not what you want...
